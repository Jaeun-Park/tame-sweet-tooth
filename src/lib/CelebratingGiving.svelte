    <h2>Celebrating the Power of Giving</h2>
    <p>
        Every year, Carnegie Mellon University’s Food Drive reflects the incredible spirit of unity and compassion among students, faculty, and staff. Through donations and efforts, our campus community comes together to make a meaningful impact on food insecurity in the Greater Pittsburgh area.
    </p>
    <p>
        This 31st Annual Food Drive is a testament to CMU’s enduring commitment to social responsibility. By joining forces with the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, we’re providing meals, hope, and strength to those in need. With each year’s growing participation, CMU continues to make a lasting difference in addressing food insecurity in our region.

        As Jim Garrett, Provost and Honorary Chair of the Food Drive, proudly says: <br>
        <em>“Each year, it is a delight to see our students, faculty and staff unite to make a meaningful difference in addressing food insecurity in our region.”</em>
